Digital attendance system based on group picture using PCA algorithm and HaarCascade Algorithm 


The codes submitted corresponds to creating a face recognition system based on PCA algorithm 
and using basic Linear Algebra. 

The code consists of two parts 
1) The face recognition part which will recognise faces based on PCA analysis
2) The group.py which will extract faces from the group first, so that I can apply the face recognition algorithm on the faces.

Overall this project aims at dimension reduction and face recognition using basic PCA and Linear Algebra.
